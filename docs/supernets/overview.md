:::caution Active development

The Supernets documentation is a work in progress. Currently, this Hub only extends
the original **[<ins>Polygon Edge</ins>](/edge/overview.md)** documentation to provide material for
the functionality in the
**[v0.7.0-alpha release](https://github.com/0xPolygon/polygon-edge/releases/tag/v0.7.0-alpha1)**.

**The code is undergoing an audit and should not yet be used in production environments.**
Please get in touch with the Polygon team if you would like to use it in production or have any questions.

## Introduction

Polygon Supernets are a customizable, modular, and extensible blockchain stack that
can be used to build highly robust and forward-compatible application-specific blockchains.

Supernets remove the complexity of blockchain development by providing premium support
to help you build your blockchain without the hassle of maintaining blockchain infrastructure.

It is built on top of [Polygon Edge](../edge/overview.md), a modular and extensible
framework for building Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks, child chains, and general scaling
solutions.

## Using Supernets for Next-Generation Blockchains

The Matic network, later rebranded as Polygon, rose to success by prioritizing users and
developers. With the introduction of Supernets, building blockchains has become a seamless
process for developers. Supernets offer a simplified version of Polygon Edge and eliminate
the hassle of blockchain infrastructure and the bootstrapping process, allowing developers
to concentrate on their use case.

Supernets offer a plug-and-play approach to building blockchains from scratch and the
response from developers has been overwhelming.

### The Supernet pillars

1. **Operational excellence**: focuses on creating continuous improvement standards
   and operational excellence. This includes establishing and maintaining a foundation
   for operational excellence.

2. **Security**: focuses on protecting data confidentiality, integrity,
   and availability.

3. **Reliability**: focuses on creating a highly available and resilient blockchain architecture
   that can withstand failures and disruptions.

4. **Performance efficiency**: focuses on optimizing resource use to improve applications'
   performance and reduce costs.

5. **Cost optimization**: focuses on reducing the cost of running blockchain in the cloud
   or on-premise without sacrificing performance or functionality.

### Why Supernets?

Supernets offer a unique solution for the appchain ecosystem, delivering built-in EVM
compatibility and advanced capabilities to developers and system architects.

When deciding to use Supernets, there are two main themes to consider: **block space**
and **compliance**.

- To meet specific regulatory requirements not attainable on a permissionless chain,
  Supernets provide whitelisted addresses and customizable access controls.
- For high transaction finality, performance (TPS), and block space needs, Supernets
  allow for custom configurations and hosting of your validators.
  > However, all Supernets still have access to Polygon's proven PoS validators.
- For launching a utility token and absorbing costs for users, Supernets grant complete control
  over the native (gas) token and the ability to mint more using the Supernet precompile
  contract.
- To deliver web 2.0 experiences or integrate with internal information systems, Supernets
  allow for customization of the EVM to meet specific requirements.
- For implementing application-specific access controls on all on-chain transactions,
  Supernets provide strict access controls to secure data.
