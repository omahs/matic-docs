:::caution Active Development: Bridge is not yet available

The Supernets documentation is a work in progress. Currently, this Hub only extends
the original **[<ins>Polygon Edge</ins>](/edge/overview.md)** documentation to provide material for
the functionality in the
**[<ins>v0.7.0-alpha release</ins>](https://github.com/0xPolygon/polygon-edge/releases/tag/v0.7.0-alpha1)**.

The native bridge capabilities are not yet part of Supernets.

**The code is undergoing an audit and should not yet be used in production environments.**
The material here is subject to change. Please get in touch with the Polygon team if you would like
to use it in production or have any questions.

## In-built bridge integration

With the help of PolyBFT, the Polygon client supports an in-built bridging mechanism (a two-way bridge),
which enables arbitrary message passing between a Supernet (`childchain`) and another proof-of-stake
blockchain (`rootchain`). Transfers can occur without mapping.
> Messages can be any type of data (arbitrary bytes).
> The bridge is an add-on ontop of PolyBFT which can be enabled or disabled.

The bridge uses the same consensus protocol and does not need a third-party application
[chainbridge](additional-features/chainbridge/overview.md)

Message passing between a `rootchain` to a given `childchain` is accomplished by continuously
syncing the state of the `rootchain` with the `childchain`, known as `StateSync`. These transfers of state happen between system calls.

> `StateSync` is a mechanism that can be used in the context of blockchain systems to facilitate real-time synchronization.

When passing messages from a `childchain` to a `rootchain`, the validator set will commit checkpoints,
a snapshot of the `childchain` state, which only includes the root of the `Exit` events, and not all
transactions. Checkpoints are used by the client as a reference point. All transactions that occur on
the `childchain` are checkpointed to the `rootchain` on a periodic basis by the validators. Liveliness
is also ensured via checkpoints. The checkpoints are submitted to the associated `rootchain` asset
contract.

> A blockchain checkpoint is a point in the blockchain at which the state of the network is recorded and stored.
> This can serve as a reference point for the blockchain, allowing validators to verify the integrity and accuracy of the
> data on the network.

The bridge can be in one of three states:

- **Pending**: the events are waiting to bundle and be sent over.
- **Committed**: the event data has been relayed over to the associated chain.
- **Executed**: the event was committed and the state was executed resulting in a state change.

The bridge supports `ERC20`, `ERC721`, and other token standards.
