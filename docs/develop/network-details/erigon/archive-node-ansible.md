To set the Archive Node, you need to follow the same process for a [<ins>full node deployment using Ansible</ins>](/docs/develop/network-details/full-node-deployment). However, it requires a minor configuration change. You should include the following parameter in the `start.sh` file:

```makefile
--gcmode 'archive'
```
