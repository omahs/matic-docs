**Venly (prev. Arkane Network)** allows you to easily integrate your app to the Polygon blockchain, whether you already have an app integrated with Web3 or are building a new app from scratch. Venly provides a smooth and delightful experience for you and your users on both web & mobile.

Venly will help you in interacting with the Polygon network, create blockchain wallets, create different asset types such as fungible (ERC20), and non-fungible tokens (ERC721 and ERC1155) and interact with smart contracts. Next to a superior developer experience, you can give your users a user-friendly interface.

Each application is unique and has different needs, therefore they provide different ways of interacting with Venly. Applications that have support for Web3 are recommendated to integrate the [Venly Web3 provider](https://docs.venly.io/widget/web3-provider/getting-started), others are suggested to use the [Venly Widget](https://docs.venly.io/widget/widget/introduction).


## Key Features

- Support Web and Mobile
- Offers social logins
- Offers fiat-on-ramp
- Supports both Polygon and Ethereum
- Supports NFTs (ERC721 and ERC1155) on Polygon
- Easy to integrate using Web3 
- Built for a mainstream audience
- Offers in-app customer support 

## Getting Started

If you already support Web3 technology, you can improve the UX within your application by integrating the **Venly Web3 Provider**, a smart wrapper around the existing Web3 Ethereum JavaScript API.

By making use of our Web3 provider you are able to leverage the full potential of Venly with minimal effort and you will be able to onboard users that are less tech savvy without making them leave your application or download third party plugins. Integrating just takes 2 steps and ~5 minutes.

:::tip 

Venly provides a [<ins>Venly Widget</ins>](https://docs.venly.io/widget/) to help developers generate Web 3 support to their applications.

### Add the library to your project

Install the library by downloading it to your project via NPM.

```
npm i @venly/web3-provider
```

Add the script to the head of your page.

```
<script src="/node_modules/@venly/web3-provider/dist/web3-provider.js"></script>
```

After adding the javascript file to your page, a global **Venly** object is added to your window. This object is the gateway for creating the Web3 wrapper and fully integrates the widget - Venly Connect.

### Initialize the Web3 provider

Add the following lines of code to your project, it will load the Venly web3 provider.

```js
Venly.createProviderEngine({clientId: 'Testaccount'}).then(provider => {
    web3 = new Web3(provider);
});
```

The web3 instance now works as if it was injected by Parity or Metamask. You can fetch wallets, sign transactions, and messages.

**Congratulations! Your dApp now supports Venly.**

## More about Venly

What makes Venly (prev. Arkane) stand out is their commitment to supporting the ecosystem. Not only their wallet users, by explaining what gas is, or by helping them import an Ethereum wallet into Polygon, but also the developers that are using Venly to build new upcoming products.

Even in their test environments, they add an in-app chat so that developers can directly communicate with the team behind the Venly platform. In case you want to learn more, check out their [detailed product documentation](https://docs.venly.io/widget/).
