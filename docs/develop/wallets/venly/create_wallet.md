If you are looking for a user-friendly wallet on Polygon network, consider creating a [Venly (prev. Arkane Network)](https://www.venly.io/) wallet. It allows you to enable a recovery mechanism and comes with end-user support via their in-app chat.
## Sign Up to Venly

**Step 1 &rarr;** Navigate to the official [Venly](https://www.venly.io/) website and click on the **My Wallet** button in the top right corner.

**Step 3 &rarr;** After signing up with one of your social accounts or with your email-id and password, you will need to accept their terms and conditions.

**Step 4 &rarr;** To secure the wallet, you need to configure a PIN. Keep in mind that your PIN should be between 4 to 6 digits. After entering the PIN, press **Set** and it will take you to the [Venly Wallet](https://wallet.venly.io/) page.

## Create Your Wallet

Now that you've configured your PIN, you are all set to create a Polygon wallet. Select Polygon from the list of various blockchain networks listed on Venly.

Once you've pressed the button, Venly will ask you to confirm the new wallet creation using your PIN (the one you configured a few steps before). After that your wallet will be created and you will be taken to your dashboard.
