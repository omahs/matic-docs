Depending on which Arkane environment your application connect, your transactions will be directed to a specific blockchain network. Connect to the Venly (prev. Arkane) production environment and you will be contacting the Polygon Mainnet, whereas connecting to the Venly staging environment will connect you to the Polygon Mumbai testnet.

Below you will find an overview of the public Venly environments and networks to which they connect.

:::note

If you are a developer, it is possible to use different networks or even your own infrastructure. For more information, refer to [<ins>the Venly documentation</ins>](https://docs.venly.io/widget/).
