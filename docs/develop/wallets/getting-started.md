:::caution Non-native wallet support

Wallets denoted with * in the table above are not natively supported with the wallet software 
and require manual steps to add the Polygon network.

## Key Management Strategy

The following basic steps allow for the integration of a client-side application with Polygon:

1. **Set up Web3**: [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) is a javascript library that 
   allows a client-side application to talk to the blockchain. We configure web3.js to communicate 
   via a developer-based wallet like MetaMask. Use the [web3.js docs](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.2/getting-started.html#adding-web3-js) to learn about adding `web3.js` to your project.
2. **Set up an Account**: You will be able to send transactions (specifically those that alter the 
   state of the blockchain).
3. **Instantiate Contracts**: Once a web3 object is in place, we next instantiate our deployed contract, 
   with which we interact.
4. **Call functions**: Fetch data via functions in the contract through our contract object.
