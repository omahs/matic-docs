If you are wondering how to create a new cryptocurrency wallet, consider creating one by installing the MetaMask extension.

MetaMask is a free and secure browser extension that allows web applications to read and interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

## Step 1. Install MetaMask on your browser

To create a new wallet with MetaMask you need to install the extension first. You can install MetaMask for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ether-metamask/), Brave and [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/metamask/) browsers.

1. Open [https://metamask.io](https://metamask.io/) or search for “Metamask extension” using your favorite search engine.

:::note
In this tutorial we will be using Google Chrome as an example, but the workflow is the same for all browsers.

2. Click **Download** to install MetaMask as a Google Chrome extension.

3. Click **Add to Chrome.**

4. Click **Add Extension**.

</div>

That’s it! You have successfully installed MetaMask extension!

## Step 2. Create an account

The next step is to create an account.

1. When the download is finished, you will be able to either **restore a wallet** with a Secret Recovery Phrase or **create a new account**, by creating a new wallet and generating a new Secret Recovery Phrase.

<div align="center">
<img src={useBaseUrl("img/metamask/develop/new-metamask.png")} />
</div>

2. You will be asked to create a new password. Create a strong password and click **Create**.

<div align="center" >
<img width="500" src={useBaseUrl("img/metamask/develop/create-password.png")} />
</div>

3. MetaMask will then provide some information about the Secret Recovery Phrase and on the next page you will see your phrase. 

<div align="center" >
<img  src={useBaseUrl("img/metamask/develop/reveal-phrase.png")} />
</div>


4. Write the 12-word phrase down  on a piece of paper on the same order presented.

:::caution
Read carefully Metamask's instructions. Write this phrase on a piece of paper and store in a secure location. If you want even more security, write it down on multiple pieces of paper and store each in 2–3 different locations. You can even memorize this phrase.
:::

5. Verify your secret phrase by selecting the previously generated phrase. When done, click **Confirm**.

By “solving this puzzle” you are confirming that you know your secret phrase.

**Congratulations!** You have successfully created your MetaMask account. A new Ethereum wallet address was automatically generated for you!
