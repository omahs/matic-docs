# Types of Blockchain Networks

Following are the major types of blockchain networks:

## Public Blockchain Network

Anyone can read or write a transaction to the network, or participate in the consensus process. They are considered to be "permissionless". Every transaction is on the public network with privacy of encrypted data, which helps user's remain pseudonymous.

## Private Blockchain Network

Private Blockchain are run and controlled by a single organization that determines who can read, write and participate in consensus process. Since they are 100% centralized, private blockchain is useful for sandbox environments and not for Production.

## Semi-private Blockchain Network

This network is run by a single company that grants access to any user who satisfies a pre-established criteria. Although it's not truly decentralized, this solution is appealing to business-to-business use cases and government applications.

## Consortium Blockchain Network

In a consortium blockchain, the consensus process in handled by a group of people. The right to read and write may be public or restricted to a participant. Consortium blockchains are considered to be "permissioned blockchains" and best suited for organizations and enterprises.
