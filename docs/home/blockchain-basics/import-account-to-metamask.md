# Importing an Account to Metamask

You can always import your account to MetaMask if you're using any other web / mobile wallet. All you need is to make sure that you have a backup of your seed phrase.

## Installing Metamask

In order to import you account, you first need to make sure that you install the MetaMask extension on your browser. To install MetaMask extension, you should use this link: https://metamask.io

Once you install it you will be asked to either **Import your Account** or **Create a New one**.

Choose the option of **Import Wallet**.

## Importing your account to Metamask

Keep your seed phrase handy now.

When you click on Import Wallet, you will be navigated to a different screen which will ask you to enter your seedphrase. You will also be asked to set a password.

Make sure that you are adding the seed phrase securely to Metamask. Once you add the seed phrase, make sure that you also add a strong password.

Agree to the **Terms and Conditions** and then click on **Import**. 

You are now set. You will have successfully imported your account to Metamask.

By default, only ETH is listed in Metamask. If you already have Matic tokens then that too will be listed automatically. In order to view your other tokens, you can click on "Add Tokens" and search the token you want to be listed.

Do keep extreme care of your seed phrase and keep backups, because unlike exchanges, you need to keep your seed phrase safe. If the seed phrase is lost, funds are not recoverable. Also never share this seed phrase with anyone.

## Sending MATIC tokens from Binance and other exchanges to the MetaMask wallet

Most exchanges like Binance and others have an option to withdraw funds from your exchange account to your address on the Ethereum blockchain. Once you have set up an account in Metamask, you will see the address of your account.

To send MATIC tokens to Metamask, withdraw funds from your exchange account to the MetaMask address. After some time, the funds will get reflected in the MetaMask account.
