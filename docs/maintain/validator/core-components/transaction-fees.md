Each [block producer](/docs/maintain/glossary.md#block-producer) on the [Bor](/docs/maintain/glossary.md#bor) layer is given a certain percentage of the transaction fees collected in each block.

The selection of producers for any given span is dependent on the validatorâ€™s ratio in the overall stake. The remaining transaction fees flow through the same funnel as the rewards which get shared among all validators working at the [Heimdall](/docs/maintain/glossary.md#heimdall) layer.
